# ChexMix ðŸ¥¨

This project will most assuredly never be finished, if ever even started... On the off-chance that
this project does get farther than a repo and a simple readme, the goal would be to implement some
microparsers and microchecks based on the Î¼Chex system by Fraser Brown, Andres Notzli, Dawson Engler
at Stanford. The paper is listed below:


[How to Build Static Checking Systems
Using Orders of Magnitude Less Code](http://iot.stanford.edu/pubs/fraser-less-code.pdf) -
[Mirror](http://web.stanford.edu/~mlfbrown/paper.pdf)


Maybe one day, someone will implement a fixer, and it can be called ChexFix. Let's be honest though; this will be the final commit.
